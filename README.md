# Build an Apartment Starter Project

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Versions
- Unity 2017.1.0p4
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0

## Target Platform:
- Android


## Personal Note:
Because I've been reading a lot about Hygge recently, I wanted to make my apartment as cosy and inviting as possible, so I filled it up with things I love: refurbished wood, brick walls, cat photos, nice lights, old lampshades, soothing sounds and music to unwind. 

My Skybox is not a busy city, but a nice relaxing mountain scenery and to mute up background noises you only need to turn on the music.

Developing this, I felt like a kid in a candy store.
